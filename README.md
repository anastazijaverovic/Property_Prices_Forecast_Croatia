Property_Prices_Forecast_Croatia

This repository is used to explore World Bank data and Croatian statistics data on property pricing index in correlation to gdp, unemployment rates, purchasing power and interest rates.
The project is programmed in R, and the first part consists of data preprocessing and exploration. Many of the data sources like Croatian statistics data and Eurodata is differently formatted so there is a lot of additional table formatting and cleaning, as well as dataset binding.
Then, Multiple linear regression is used to fit to the data and to predict the result. There have been very few of the data samples for the data on Croatia, so the next natural step is to add more data on some other countries to train the model on.
